       "\n",
       "*   **Support for Disabilities and Death:** In cases of accidental death while in service, the fund provides financial aid and scholarships to dependents.  It also offers financial aid and other forms of rehabilitation assistance to workers affected by natural disasters to ensure their satisfactory rehabilitation.  For workers permanently disabled due to accidents while in service, the fund provides orthopedic appliances like wheelchairs, hand-held supports, crutches, hearing aids, and spectacles.  Dependents of these workers also receive financial aid and scholarships if they are pursuing studies.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Occupational Health and Safety:**  The fund conducts awareness programs on occupational health and safety to protect workers from occupational hazards.  This contributes to developing a healthier and more energetic workforce.\n"
