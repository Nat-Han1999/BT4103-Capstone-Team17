        "bot": "The Shrama Vasana Fund offers legal aid to workers who may find themselves in situations where they've been unfairly dismissed from their jobs.  Let's break down how this works:   Scenario:  Imagine a worker who is fired without a proper reason or is facing an unjustified investigation by their employer. This worker can turn to the Shrama Vasana Fund for help.   Legal Assistance: The fund can connect the worker with a lawyer or legal representative. They can help the worker file a complaint and navigate the legal process.   Financial Support:  The Shrama Vasana Fund can provide financial aid up to Rs. 20,000 to cover some of the legal expenses the worker might face. This helps ensure they have access to legal representation.   To qualify for this legal aid, there are a few conditions:   Salary Limit: The worker's basic salary at the time of dismissal shouldn't be more than Rs. 30,000.  If their salary, including allowances, was higher, it shouldn't exceed Rs. 15,000.   Formal Complaint:  The worker needs to have filed a formal complaint with a recognized legal body. These could include the Labour Tribunal, Industrial Court, Labour Compensation Commissioner, or the Service Termination Division of the Labour Department.    Does that answer your question about how the Shrama Vasana Fund assists workers who are let go from their jobs without notice?"
