The Shrama Vasana Fund scholarships are specifically for dependents of workers whose death or permanent disability was a direct result of a workplace accident. Since your mom's disability is due to diabetes, it unfortunately doesn't meet the criteria for this particular scholarship. However, please don't give up. There are many other scholarships available based on financial need or academic merit. I highly recommend exploring those options."

The Shrama Vasana Fund scholarships are specifically for dependents of workers whose death or permanent disability resulted directly from a workplace accident.  Since your mother's disability was caused by diabetes, it unfortunately doesn't meet the requirements for this specific scholarship. Even though work stress may have played a role, the direct cause doesn't align with the fund's criteria. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but try looking into scholarships based on financial need or academic merit.  There are many other options out there, so I encourage you not to give up."
