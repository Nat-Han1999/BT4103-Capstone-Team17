Minister of Labour. This initiative was a natural outcome of his background as a leader working in close collaboration with the working class. This initiative was indeed a great achievement for the entire working population.A significant step forward was taken in 1998 by the launching of a lottery named \"Shrama Vasana\", in collaboration with the National Lotteries Board in order to collect funds for the Shrama Vasana Fund. This is the only lottery organized for the benefit of the working class. With time, this lottery improved acquiring additional features like Devedda 1 (oEjeoao 1& and Devedda 2 (oEjeoao 2& effectively competing with other lotteries thus enhancing the financial base of Shrama Vasana Fund.With considerable effort, arrangements were made to draw the lottery every Sunday commencing on 18th Dec. 2012.The earning capacity of the lottery was strengthened by this move. It was later observed that Sunday being a holiday, people could not be contacted in large numbers for the sale of tickets and there was a tendency for the vendors to go on holiday. The sales declined. Therefore with effect from 06 March 2010, Saturday Jathika Sampatha replaced the Sunday lottery, with a variety of new attractive gifts and a different out look.
